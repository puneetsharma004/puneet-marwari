Navigation Menu
-	Home (Remove other home pages)
-	(Rest Keep as it is)
-	Navbar should start translucent
-	On scroll → transition smoothly to solid black

Color Scheme Update (Important)
The client wants to shift toward a more royal, classic aesthetic using:
•	Black
•	White
•	Gray tones
•	Background accent color: #E8E2DD
They specifically mentioned they like #E8E2DD as a primary background tone, so we should incorporate that thoughtfully across sections to keep the site elegant and cohesive.
Typography
•	Josefin Sans for headings and navbar
•	A complementary, readable font for body text
**They will initially launch with 3–4 travel packages only, so layout should feel:
•	Premium
•	Focused
•	Not crowded
•	Clean and high-end
